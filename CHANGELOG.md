-  🕵️‍♀️ Vulnerabilities have been addressed

## Important Notes

We have had security audits performed on OAuth2 Proxy in the past couple of weeks and as a result we have fixed
several CRITICAL vulnerabilities.

The security vulnerabilities include multiple authentication bypasses and a potential session fixation attack.
For more details and to identify if you are effects, we urge all users of OAuth2 Proxy to read the security 
disclosures.

- (Critical) [GHSA-5hvv-m4w4-gf6v](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-5hvv-m4w4-gf6v) fix: health check user-agent authentication bypass 
- (Critical) [GHSA-7x63-xv5r-3p2x](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-7x63-xv5r-3p2x) fix: authentication bypass via X-Forwarded-Uri header spoofing
- (High) [GHSA-pxq7-h93f-9jrg](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-pxq7-h93f-9jrg) fix: fragment evaluation as part of the allowed routes
- (Moderate) [GHSA-c5c4-8r6x-56w3](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-c5c4-8r6x-56w3) fix: email validation bypass via malformed multi-@ email claims

Furthermore, for improving the security of OAuth2 Proxy we introduced a new flag `--trusted-proxy-ip` that allows users
to explicitly specify trusted reverse proxy IPs for the `X-Forwarded-*` headers. This is an important step to prevent 
potential header spoofing attacks and to ensure that OAuth2 Proxy only trusts headers from known and trusted sources.
We highly recommend users to review their deployment architecture and consider using this flag to enhance the security 
of their OAuth2 Proxy instances. Check the docs for more details: https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration/overview#proxy-options

Furthermore, we want to thank everyone who contributed to the audits and reported potential issues to make open source 
software like OAuth2 Proxy more secure for everyone.

# V7.15.0

## Release Highlights

- 🔒 OIDC JWT signing algorithms can now be configured
- 🍪 CSRF cookie improvements (SameSite option, proper expiration validation)
- 🧪 Configuration validation flag: --config-test
- 🔌 Unix socket file mode support
- 👤 Session state can now be extend with arbitrary claims from ID Token and upstream IDP user profiles endpoint
    - This opens the door for multiple features like:
    - Additional arbitrary header values for any claims your IDP provides
    - Extended OAuth2 Proxy UserInfo endpoint with all additional claims
    - Read the docs [here](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration/alpha-config#how-to-utilize-arbitrary-claims-provided-by-your-identity-provider)

## Important Notes

CSRF cookie validation now correctly uses `CSRFExpire` instead of `Expire`. If you relied on the previous behavior, review your session timeout configuration.
Check the [documentation(https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration/overview#cookie-options) for `cookie-csrf-expire`.

# V7.14.3

## Release Highlights

- 🔵 Go1.25.7 and upgrade of dependencies to latest versions
  - Fixes [CVE-2025-68121](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2025-68121)
- 🐛 Bug fixes
  - Allow Redis URL parameters to configure username, password and max idle connection timeout if the matching configuration is empty.

## Important Notes

We improved our supply chain security by added additional checks to prevent potential command injection in the publish release workflow and to ensure that it can only be triggered from branches originating in the local repository. This potential issue was reported by automated systems as well as a couple of security researchers, and we want to thank everyone for their diligence in looking out for the security of the project. Especially Aastha Aggarwal for her detailed report and follow-up. @Aastha2602


## Breaking Changes

## Changes since v7.14.2

- [#3183](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/3183) fix: allow URL parameters to configure username, password and max idle connection timeout if the matching configuration is empty.

# V7.14.2

## Release Highlights

- Revert AuthOnly endpoint change from v7.14.1 that caused issues when using `skip-provider-button` enabled

## Important Notes

- This release reverts the change made in v7.14.1 that caused issues when using the `skip-provider-button` enabled. Now, when a session does not exist, the AuthOnly endpoint will send a 401 status code as expected instead of a 302 redirect. And instead we extended the documentation to clarify the behavior when using `nginx` with `auth_request` and `skip-provider-button` and how to properly configure redirects for browser and API routes.

  - [CVE-2025-58181](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2025-58181)
- 🗂️ AMajor Alpha Config YAML parsing revamped for better extensibility and preparing v8
- 🐛 Squashed some bugs

## Important Notes

This release introduces a breaking change for Alpha Config users and moves us significantly 
closer to removing legacy configuration parameters, making the codebase of OAuth2 Proxy more
future proof and extensible.

From v7.14.0 onward, header injection sources must be explicitly nested. If you
previously relied on squashed fields, update to the new structure before upgrading:

```yaml
# before v7.14.0
injectRequestHeaders:
- name: X-Forwarded-User
  values:
  - claim: user
- name: X-Custom-Secret-header
  values:
  - value: my-super-secret

# v7.14.0 and later
injectRequestHeaders:
- name: X-Forwarded-User
  values:
  - claimSource:
      claim: user
- name: X-Custom-Secret-header
  values:
  - secretSource:
      value: my-super-secret
```

Furthermore, Alpha Config now fully supports configuring the `Server` struct using YAML.

```yaml
// Server represents the configuration for the Proxy HTTP(S) configuration.
type Server struct {
	// BindAddress is the address on which to serve traffic.
	BindAddress string `yaml:"bindAddress,omitempty"`

	// SecureBindAddress is the address on which to serve secure traffic.
	SecureBindAddress string `yaml:"secureBindAddress,omitempty"`

	// TLS contains the information for loading the certificate and key for the
	// secure traffic and further configuration for the TLS server.
	TLS *TLS `yaml:"tls,omitempty"`
}

// TLS contains the information for loading a TLS certificate and key
// as well as an optional minimal TLS version that is acceptable.
type TLS struct {
    // Key is the TLS key data to use.
	Key *SecretSource `yaml:"key,omitempty"`
    // Cert is the TLS certificate data to use.
	Cert *SecretSource `yaml:"cert,omitempty"`
    // MinVersion is the minimal TLS version that is acceptable.
	MinVersion string `yaml:"minVersion,omitempty"`
    // CipherSuites is a list of TLS cipher suites that are allowed.
	CipherSuites []string `yaml:"cipherSuites,omitempty"`
}
```

More about how to use Alpha Config can be found in the [documentation](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration/alpha-config#server).

We are committed to Semantic Versioning and usually avoid breaking changes without a major version release.
Advancing Alpha Config toward its Beta stage required this exception, and even for the Alpha Config we try
to keep breaking changes in v7 to a minium. Thank you for understanding the need for this step to prepare
the project for future maintainability and future improvements like structured logging.

## Breaking Changes

- Alpha Config: header injection no longer supports squashed claim/secret sources; they must now be set explicitly (see example above).
